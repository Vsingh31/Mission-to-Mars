# Mission-to-Mars
**HTML Web scraping on Mars data to create a Flask web application using Python and MongoDB**
## Overview
The mission with this project was to learn web scraping methods to extract information from the [Mars Hemispheres](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) website using Chrome Developer tools to identify HTML components, Beautiful Soup/Splinter to automate a web browser and perform the scrape, MongoDB to store the data, and finally Flask to create a web application to display the data. Through the process, the goal was to develop an app to scrape the following information about the planet Mars:

* Latest News
* Featured Image
* Facts about the planet
* Images of the hemispheres
* 
### Deliverable 1
To start, I created the file "Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb" in Jupyter notebook to perform the scraping activity and Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, I scraped  full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images and I got the image URLs and titles for all four hemisphere images.The images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images are:-
